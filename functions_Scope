//Function Scope - zakres
//variables declared outside functions are global,
//variables which are declared inside of a function are local,

var scope = "public"; //this scope is global

function checkScope(){
    var scope = "private"; //this scope is local
    return scope;
}

scope; //to get an acess to global scope
checkScope(); //to acess local scope

//another callback way
var scope2 = "public";
var newScope2 = "global variable";
function checkScope2() {
    var scope2 = "private";
    return [scope2, newScope2];
}

//scope chain
//like an children don't have acess to the cash, but they can get something bought for the money 
//from they parents, also they don't have acess to the car, but can get acess to the transport
//by adults
//child scope >> parent scope >> global scope

//local scope can't,  look outside it's scope/zakres to find some variable
//but global scope can't look inside the eg.function to find some variable

//var keyword - if we don't declare variables with var on the front,
//then those variables are automatically a global variables
dog = "Oscar";      //global
var dog = "Oscar";  //local - best practise to use it

var scopeX = "public"; //this scope is global
function checkScopeX(){
    scopeX = "private"; //this scope is local
    return scopeX;
}

//to solve above - use strict mode!!
